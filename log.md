# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 6/19/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on personal webpage- focus on CSS grid

**Thoughts:** Not really understanding minmax() and return. My page is responsive until < 200px and the card container breaks down. 

### Day 1: 6/20/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Did CS50 Memory lecture, JavaScript Free Code Camp section

**Thoughts:** After going up to React and working back from HTML and CSS, I'm back at Javascript again and realizing the real learning happens when it's hard and I have to grind.  

### Day 2: 6/21/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp ES6 section, mostly through Regex section

**Thoughts:** Need review on getters and setters, as well as more definition memorization for basic components of functions. Instead of waffling about on different resources, I should stick to one source (FCC) for at least until finished with React, so I can go back to Zero to Mastery and hopefully make sense of the Star Wars API project. 

### Day 3: 6/28/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp Regex, debugging, started on data structures, CS50 Data Structures

**Thoughts:** After the worst cold of my life and then hand/wrist/leg debilitating symptoms I'm back at the keyboard. How often are Regex actually used for your average web dev? One day at a time- one hour. Put in the work over time to get results.  Signed up for a workshop on tech jobs where I live so I'm excited to meet real people.
