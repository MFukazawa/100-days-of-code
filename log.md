# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 6/19/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on personal webpage- focus on CSS grid

**Thoughts:** Not really understanding minmax() and return. My page is responsive until < 200px and the card container breaks down. 

### Day 1: 6/20/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Did CS50 Memory lecture, JavaScript Free Code Camp section

**Thoughts:** After going up to React and working back from HTML and CSS, I'm back at Javascript again and realizing the real learning happens when it's hard and I have to grind.  

### Day 2: 6/21/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp ES6 section, mostly through Regex section

**Thoughts:** Need review on getters and setters, as well as more definition memorization for basic components of functions. Instead of waffling about on different resources, I should stick to one source (FCC) for at least until finished with React, so I can go back to Zero to Mastery and hopefully make sense of the Star Wars API project. 

### Day 3: 6/28/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp Regex, debugging, started on data structures, CS50 Data Structures

**Thoughts:** After the worst cold of my life and then hand/wrist/leg debilitating symptoms I'm back at the keyboard. How often are Regex actually used for your average web dev? One day at a time- one hour. Put in the work over time to get results.  Signed up for a workshop on tech jobs where I live so I'm excited to meet real people.

### Day 4: 7/1/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp data structures, assemble 3 javascript ideas to teach to mentor

**Thoughts:** Monday Monday back to studying. Worked through data structures and it's clear I've made a lot of progress in understanding objects, arrays, and methods compared to a month ago. My hands aren't healed yet but typing speed is slowly increasing again. In a week it will be 2 months since I began full-time studying. I have come far but there's a LONG way to go. 

### Day 5: 7/2/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp basic algorithms, followed up with mentor on javascript ideas

**Thoughts:** Though I had to really think about these algorithms, if I talk out loud (rubber duck debugging) I can logic through a fair bit of the problems. The other piece is exposure to more material so I'm aware of the possibilities for solution. I also checked out Josh Waitzkin x Tim Ferriss's recent discussion today on compressing learning, as well as peeked at The Art of Learning.  By putting in reps and focusing on process over progress I'm doing the right thing. 

### Day 6: 7/3/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp basic algorithms - finished, began Object Oriented Programming section

**Thoughts:** Algorithms were challenging but after completing the section I think my programmer logic has improved a bit. Now heading into Object Oriented Programming and the concepts are somewhat familiar thanks to Zero to Mastery but the clarification is just what I needed. Onward and upward!
