# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 6/19/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on personal webpage- focus on CSS grid

**Thoughts:** Not really understanding minmax() and return. My page is responsive until < 200px and the card container breaks down. 

### Day 1: 6/20/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Did CS50 Memory lecture, JavaScript Free Code Camp section

**Thoughts:** After going up to React and working back from HTML and CSS, I'm back at Javascript again and realizing the real learning happens when it's hard and I have to grind.  

### Day 2: 6/21/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp ES6 section

**Thoughts:** Need review on getters and setters, as well as more definition memorization for basic components of functions
