# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 6/19/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on personal webpage- focus on CSS grid

**Thoughts:** Not really understanding minmax() and return. My page is responsive until < 200px and the card container breaks down. 

### Day 1: 6/20/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Did CS50 Memory lecture, JavaScript Free Code Camp section

**Thoughts:** After going up to React and working back from HTML and CSS, I'm back at Javascript again and realizing the real learning happens when it's hard and I have to grind.  

### Day 2: 6/21/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp ES6 section, mostly through Regex section

**Thoughts:** Need review on getters and setters, as well as more definition memorization for basic components of functions. Instead of waffling about on different resources, I should stick to one source (FCC) for at least until finished with React, so I can go back to Zero to Mastery and hopefully make sense of the Star Wars API project. 

### Day 3: 6/28/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp Regex, debugging, started on data structures, CS50 Data Structures

**Thoughts:** After the worst cold of my life and then hand/wrist/leg debilitating symptoms I'm back at the keyboard. How often are Regex actually used for your average web dev? One day at a time- one hour. Put in the work over time to get results.  Signed up for a workshop on tech jobs where I live so I'm excited to meet real people.

### Day 4: 7/1/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp data structures, assemble 3 javascript ideas to teach to mentor

**Thoughts:** Monday Monday back to studying. Worked through data structures and it's clear I've made a lot of progress in understanding objects, arrays, and methods compared to a month ago. My hands aren't healed yet but typing speed is slowly increasing again. In a week it will be 2 months since I began full-time studying. I have come far but there's a LONG way to go. 

### Day 5: 7/2/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp basic algorithms, followed up with mentor on javascript ideas

**Thoughts:** Though I had to really think about these algorithms, if I talk out loud (rubber duck debugging) I can logic through a fair bit of the problems. The other piece is exposure to more material so I'm aware of the possibilities for solution. I also checked out Josh Waitzkin x Tim Ferriss's recent discussion today on compressing learning, as well as peeked at The Art of Learning.  By putting in reps and focusing on process over progress I'm doing the right thing. 

### Day 6: 7/3/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp basic algorithms - finished, began Object Oriented Programming section

**Thoughts:** Algorithms were challenging but after completing the section I think my programmer logic has improved a bit. Now heading into Object Oriented Programming and the concepts are somewhat familiar thanks to Zero to Mastery but the clarification is just what I needed. Onward and upward!   

### Day 7: 7/4/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp Object Oriented Programming section mostly done

**Thoughts:** OOP makes sense! Big steps from the beginning.  Ended early for 4th of July.   

### Day 8: 7/5/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp Object Oriented Programming section finished, began functional programming

**Thoughts:** Had to renew Visa today so another half day- functional programming is much less intuitive than OOP. It might create less buggy code but it's hurting my brain.  

### Day 9: 7/8/2019 
##### 
4
**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp array.prototype.map

**Thoughts:** Lots of life getting in the way of studying recently. Couldn't study much today and map/filter is still really confusing.   

### Day 10: 7/9/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp functional programming complete

**Thoughts:** Although I have a greater understanding than when I started, I'm not there yet. 

### Day 11: 7/10/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp intermediate algorithms

**Thoughts:** How much of these are memorization? They definitely show the holes in my knowledge. 

### Day 12: 7/11/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp intermediate algorithms continued

**Thoughts:** These algorithms are a slog 

### Day 13: 7/12/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp intermediate algorithms continued

**Thoughts:** More algorithms.  I solved a couple today and was on the right track on another one or two so I feel good about them. 

### Day 14: 7/16/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp intermediate algorithms continued

**Thoughts:** More algorithms.  I solved a couple today and was on the right track on another one or two so I feel good about them.  Same as day 13.

### Day 15: 7/17/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp intermediate algorithms continued

**Thoughts:** More algorithms.  Only a few more to go. 

### Day 16: 7/18/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp intermediate algorithms continued

**Thoughts:** More algorithms.  Only a few more to go. Make them stop ;_;

### Day 17: 7/19/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp intermediate algorithms FINISHED - onto the Algorithms and Data structures projects section

**Thoughts:** Finished algorithms at last.  I'm starting to recognize more patterns and it feels less like drinking out of a firehose with all the new information. I solved the first project without any hints but it was a suboptimal solution. Onto the next! I'm almost halfway until I start applying for jobs (unless the event next week results in an offer). I hope I'm doing enough.

### Day 18: 7/22/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp Algorithms and Data structures projects section

**Thoughts:** Made modest progress but am relying on hints too much. Even if the thought process is correct, the execution isn't there yet. Took my kid to the doctor early and had to pick up the wife from the airport. 

### Day 19: 7/23/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp Algorithms and Data structures projects section continued

**Thoughts:** Essentially the same as the day prior but with more time. On the last project but even though I can conceptualize what I need to do I'm not sure how to do it YET.

### Day 20: 7/24/2019 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Free Code Camp Algorithms and Data structures projects section COMPLETE

**Thoughts:** Had to use YouTube sensei to guide me through the last one. Onto the next.
